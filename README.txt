RESERVIA PROJECT 

Is a vacation planning tool online, allowing users to select accommodation and activities on the city of their choice. Accommodation can also be filtered by a set of themes, to match the users’ needs. 

This first instance is to integrate a responsive mock-up in html and css, of the landing page only. 
A different layout for mobile and desktop/laptop devices is expected. Tablet devices should also be taken into consideration.

There are 2 files on this repository - the .html with the page’s content and the .css with the styling details.
